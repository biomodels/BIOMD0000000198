# BIOMD0000000198: testid

## Installation

Download this repository, and install with distutils

`python setup.py install`

Or, install using pip

`pip install git+https://github.com/biomodels/BIOMD0000000198.git`

To install a specific version (in this example, from the 2014-09-16 BioModels release)

`pip install git+https://github.com/biomodels/BIOMD0000000198.git@20140916`

## Usage

Importing the model package.

`import BIOMD0000000198 as model`

Get the SBML string from the model

`print model.sbmlString`

If [python-libsbml](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-libsbml) bindings are
installed, the libsbml.SBMLDocument object is also accessible

`model.sbml`


# Model Notes
This features the two step binding of NO to soluble Guanylyl Cyclase as
proposed by [Stone JR, Marletta MA. Biochemistry (1996) 35(4):1093-9](http://w
ww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&lis
t_uids=8573563) . There is a fast step binding scheme and a slow step binding
scheme. The difference lies in the binding of a NO to a non-heme site on sGC,
which may not necessarily be the same site of binding during the initial
binding. The rates have been directly used models.
